        <description>
            <p>"Nomad" is a term for a member of any itinerant culture; that is, a cultural group which lacks any geographic claim. Nomad cultures typically spawn from a region or nation undergoing some great hardship, forcing a mass exodus. Due to the nature of their lifestyle, most nomad cultures are temporary, lasting only until they find new lands to settle in. However, some groups are doomed to wander endlessly, forever outsiders, a vagrant culture. Given enough time, nomad cultures will slowly lose their own history as their oral tradition distorts with each generation, and their own culture becomes distinct and independent as they absorb elements of other cultures and write their own myths. Because they are often an offshoot of older traditions, many nomad cultures may have values which seem quaint, antiquated, or archaic, even to contemporary folk of their source culture. Because they are foreigners everywhere they go, nomads are often the target of ignorance and fear, characterized as a culture of thieves, barbarians, devil worshippers, and other such nonsense by the uneducated and xenophobic. Even well-educated folk may express such prejudice toward nomads to achieve their own agendas, such as using them as scapegoats, building nationalist attitudes, finding a new source of slave labor, or justifying unfair taxation and laws. All of this forces nomads to lead a hard life, always travelling, and always faced with ignorance and prejudice wherever they arrive. With each passing generation, their culture becomes more unique, and their chances of ever reaching their destination slowly disappear.</p>

            <p>Living on the road with a performing troupe leaves you with kin in many places, such as various camps, settlements, and travelling shows. All nomads stand in defense of their family, (however loosely defined that may be) and are known to each other through subtle caravan markings, hand signals, and traditional ceremonies. Every nomad family has their own unwritten code of loyalty. Any nomad found violating the tennets of the family will find themselves on the outside looking in; always wanting but never finding shelter or help. As it's said, 'Word travels quickly on roads but lingers in cities.' An ousted nomad never finds haven in or out of towns. Work with your DM to figure out where you have family, who they are, and what your family's values are.</p>
